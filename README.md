## Setup

You don't have to set any Brizo configuration settings or other configuration settings to use on-premise storage with Brizo. You just need to make sure that Brizo can resolve the file URLs. For more details, see [the tutorial about setting up on-premise storage](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/on-premise-for-brizo/).

## Code Style

Information about our Python code style is documented in this the [python-developer-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-developer-guide.md)
and the [python-style-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-style-guide.md).

## Testing

Automatic tests are setup via Travis, executing `tox`.
Our tests use the pytest framework.

## New Version

The `bumpversion.sh` script helps to bump the project version. You can execute the script using as first argument {major|minor|patch} to bump accordingly the version.
